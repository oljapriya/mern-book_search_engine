## Mock-Up

Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

![Animation shows "star wars" typed into a search box and books about Star Wars appearing as results.](./Assets/21-mern-homework-demo-01.gif)

The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following animation:

![Animation shows user clicking "Save This Book!" button to save books that appear in search results. The button label changes to "Book Already Saved" after it is clicked and the book is saved.](./Assets/21-mern-homework-demo-02.gif)

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
